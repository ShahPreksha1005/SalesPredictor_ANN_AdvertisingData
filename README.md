# Sales Predictor Using ANN on Advertising Data

## Project Overview
This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict sales based on advertising budgets in different media channels, specifically TV and radio. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we explore the correlation between ad spending and sales, aiming to offer insights for effective advertising strategies.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Exploration**: Examines the distributions and correlations among advertising budgets and sales.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Splits the data into training, validation, and test sets; standardizes features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Constructs a Sequential ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras, trained to predict sales based on ad spend.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set.
5. **Visualizations**: Uses histograms, heatmaps, and loss curves to visualize distributions, correlations, and training dynamics.

## Key Achievements
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Detailed analysis of TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets and their relationships with sales.
- **ANN Model Performance**: Achieved an MSE around 4.87 on test data, demonstrating effective predictive capabilities.
- **Interpretative Visuals**: Included insightful plots to enhance understanding of data and model performance.

## Conclusions
This project demonstrates the power of ANN in forecasting sales based on targeted advertising spend. TV ads showed a strong correlation with sales, suggesting high impact, while radio and newspaper ads had moderate to low effects. Future improvements could involve hyperparameter tuning or incorporating additional features to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Requirements
- **Python Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
